# Issue Tracker

Tracker for kicad-happy analyzer bugs (KH-*) and test harness improvements (TH-*).
Contains enough detail to resume work with zero conversation history.

> **Protocol**: When fixing issues, remove them from this file and add to FIXED.md in the
> same session. See README.md "Issue tracking protocol" for full details. Closed issues
> with root cause and verification details are in [FIXED.md](FIXED.md).

> **Reporting guidelines for Level 3 subagents**: Root cause descriptions must cite
> specific function names and line numbers, not just file names. When claiming code
> "doesn't check X", trace the actual code path for the repro input and show which line
> returns the wrong result — don't infer from the symptom what the code must be doing.
> Common pitfalls:
> - Code checks the right field but matches the wrong strings (KH-213: checked keywords
>   for `p-channel` but actual keywords contain `PMOS`)
> - Code has the right pattern but wrong format (KH-209: matched `Vnn` but not `nnVn`)
> - Fix exists but callers bypass it (KH-212: KH-153 fix requires `component_type` param
>   that callers don't pass)
> - Transforms are applied but decomposed wrong (KH-207: `compute_pin_positions` runs but
>   matrix→angle extraction is mathematically incorrect)
>
> Include in every report: (1) the function name and line number that produces the wrong
> result, (2) the actual input values from the repro file, (3) what the code returns vs
> what it should return.

## Numbering convention

Issue numbers are **globally unique and never reused**. Before assigning a new number,
check both ISSUES.md (open) and FIXED.md (closed) for the current maximum. Next KH
number: **KH-229**. Next TH number: **TH-013**.

> 0 open issues.

## Severity levels

- **CRITICAL** -- Causes cascading failures, major data loss, or makes large portions of output unusable
- **HIGH** -- Significant accuracy impact, many false positives/negatives, or missing important data
- **MEDIUM** -- Localized false positives or misclassifications; workarounds exist
- **LOW** -- Cosmetic, minor noise, or edge cases affecting few files
