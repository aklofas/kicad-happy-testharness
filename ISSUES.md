# Issue Tracker

Single source of truth for kicad-happy analyzer bugs (KH-*) and test harness
issues (TH-*). Contains enough detail to resume work with zero conversation
history. Enhancements and features are tracked in `TODO-v1.3-roadmap.md`
in each repo, not here.

> **Protocol**: When fixing issues, remove them from this file and add to FIXED.md in the
> same session. See README.md "Issue tracking protocol" for full details. Closed issues
> with root cause and verification details are in [FIXED.md](FIXED.md).

> **Reporting guidelines for Level 3 subagents**: Root cause descriptions must cite
> specific function names and line numbers, not just file names. When claiming code
> "doesn't check X", trace the actual code path for the repro input and show which line
> returns the wrong result — don't infer from the symptom what the code must be doing.
> Common pitfalls:
> - Code checks the right field but matches the wrong strings (KH-213: checked keywords
>   for `p-channel` but actual keywords contain `PMOS`)
> - Code has the right pattern but wrong format (KH-209: matched `Vnn` but not `nnVn`)
> - Fix exists but callers bypass it (KH-212: KH-153 fix requires `component_type` param
>   that callers don't pass)
> - Transforms are applied but decomposed wrong (KH-207: `compute_pin_positions` runs but
>   matrix→angle extraction is mathematically incorrect)
>
> Include in every report: (1) the function name and line number that produces the wrong
> result, (2) the actual input values from the repro file, (3) what the code returns vs
> what it should return.

## Numbering convention

Issue numbers are **globally unique and never reused**. Before assigning a new
number, check both ISSUES.md (open) and FIXED.md (closed) for the current
maximum. Next KH number: **KH-357** (KH-354..356 filed 2026-07-16 from v2.1
gate adjudication). Next TH number: **TH-046**.

> 17 open issues.

## Severity levels

- **CRITICAL** -- Causes cascading failures, major data loss, or makes large portions of output unusable
- **HIGH** -- Significant accuracy impact, many false positives/negatives, or missing important data
- **MEDIUM** -- Localized false positives or misclassifications; workarounds exist
- **LOW** -- Cosmetic, minor noise, or edge cases affecting few files

## kicad-happy Analyzer Issues

### KH-328: `wrap_result.py` helper missing from datasheets skill

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `skills/datasheets/scripts/` (helper absent)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-19 (SacMap rev2 review of v1.4 datasheet extraction layer)

**Symptom:** Consumers of the datasheets extraction pipeline hand-roll
the `{task_id, schema_version, status, extracted_at, model_tier,
model_id, data}` result envelope. SacMap's seed implementation at
`~/Projects/sacmap/wrap_result.seed.py` demonstrates a single-file
wrapper but ships nowhere central in kicad-happy.

**Spec (from SacMap reviewer):**
- read `<mpn>.plan.json` for tier/schema/task_id auto-population
- read `x-schema-version` from schema file
- read agent output from file/stdin
- strip prose preamble + markdown fences via regex first-balanced-JSON-block extraction
- validate against schema before writing
- write failed status (`data: null`, `error: msg`) if validation fails

**Likely fix:** Ship `skills/datasheets/scripts/wrap_result.py` with the
above contract. Ask the user whether to copy the SacMap seed as a
reference starting point.

**Not tag-blocking** — convenience helper; pipeline functional without it.

---

### KH-329: `plan_extraction.py` "not implemented" error lacks next-command pointer

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `skills/datasheets/scripts/plan_extraction.py` (live-scout-dispatch path)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-19

**Symptom:** First invocation prints "live scout dispatch not implemented"
and points at a ~180-line markdown doc. The error message does not
include the exact next command to run, so users hit the wall and have
to read upstream docs to recover.

**Likely fix:** Either (a) include the exact next command in the error
message, or (b) ship the actual live-scout dispatch.

**Not tag-blocking** — error-message UX.

---

### KH-330: `base.schema.json` and `pinout.schema.json` missing `x-schema-version`

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `skills/datasheets/schemas/base.schema.json`, `skills/datasheets/schemas/pinout.schema.json`
**Discovered:** 2026-05-19

**Symptom:** Other schemas in `skills/datasheets/schemas/` (regulator,
diode, mcu, opamp, transistor, crystal) carry a top-level
`x-schema-version` field; `base.schema.json` and `pinout.schema.json`
do not. Consumers (KH-328 `wrap_result.py` spec, validators) have to
guess or fall back to a hardcoded default.

**Likely fix:** Add `"x-schema-version": "<current>"` to both files;
sync the value with whatever Phase 4 declared as the base/pinout
baseline.

**Not tag-blocking** — consumer-visible inconsistency, no behavior
divergence today.

---

### KH-331: `jsonschema` + `referencing` deps undeclared in datasheets skill

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `skills/datasheets/scripts/merge_results.py`, `skills/datasheets/scripts/validate_extraction_result.py`
**Discovered:** 2026-05-19

**Symptom:** Both scripts `import jsonschema` and use `referencing` but
the skill ships no `requirements.txt`, no SKILL.md mention, no install
instructions. On Debian this requires `pip install
--break-system-packages` for a global install. The codebase already
ships a stdlib equivalent at
`skills/datasheets/scripts/_mini_jsonschema.py` per harness memory
`feedback_stdlib_first`.

**Likely fix:** Three options:
1. Declare the dep in `requirements.txt` + SKILL.md (allows pip-install workflow).
2. Vendor / switch to the existing `_mini_jsonschema.py`.
3. Remove the dep where stdlib coverage suffices.

Preference per `feedback_stdlib_first`: option 2.

**Not tag-blocking** — works on systems where `jsonschema` is installed.

---

### KH-332: Tier B `diode` and `mcu` extractor agents emit prose preamble on long page lists

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `skills/datasheets/agents/diode.md`, `skills/datasheets/agents/mcu.md` (vs `regulator.md`)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-19 (SacMap rev2 — 2 of 9 extractor agents tripped)

**Symptom:** 2 of 9 Tier B extractor invocations emitted prose preamble
despite the prompt's "no prose, no fences" instruction. Tier B
regulator at similar page count was clean.

**Likely fix:** Diff `regulator.md` vs `diode.md` vs `mcu.md` and apply
whatever suppression pattern `regulator.md` uses to the other two.
Downstream consumers handle preamble defensively (see KH-328 spec item
"strip prose preamble"), but upstream cleanliness reduces wrap_result
fragility.

**Not tag-blocking** — extraction outputs still validate after
preamble stripping.

---

### KH-333: `capability_mode` not surfaced in datasheet `<mpn>.json` extraction output

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `skills/datasheets/scripts/merge_results.py` (output envelope)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-19

**Symptom:** EMC analyzer surfaces `capability_mode` via a separate
`capability_mode.json` artifact + `capability_mode_ref` field on the
analyzer envelope. The datasheets extraction layer surfaces it nowhere
— neither in `<mpn>.json` nor in a sidecar. Consumers cannot tell
which capability mode produced an extraction.

**Likely fix:** Either (a) add `capability_mode` (or
`capability_mode_ref`) to the extraction envelope, mirroring the EMC
pattern, or (b) document the omission in SKILL.md as intentional.

**Not tag-blocking** — provenance gap, not a correctness issue.

---

### KH-334: v1.5 — empirical determinism check for datasheet extraction pipeline

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `skills/datasheets/scripts/` (pipeline as a whole)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-19 (SacMap rev2 flagged but did not exercise)

**Symptom:** No automated check that re-running the same extraction
pipeline on the same PDF twice produces identical outputs. Temperature
defaults and tier selection could introduce silent drift. SacMap
reviewer flagged this as a concern but did not run the comparison.

**Likely fix (v1.5 carryover):** Add a smoke step that:
1. Runs full extraction on a sanity-vector MPN (e.g. LM2596-ADJ).
2. Re-runs the same pipeline.
3. Diffs the two `<mpn>.json` outputs and reports the magnitude of any
   drift (zero is target; non-zero is the calibration data point).

**Not tag-blocking** — v1.5 carryover, future work.

---

### KH-354: `audit_pwr_flags` never credits PWR_FLAG — `pwr_flag_warnings` false-positives on every flagged rail

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_schematic.py:4847` (`audit_pwr_flags`)
**Discovered:** 2026-07-16 (v2.1 gate adjudication, Siegmundshof93/kicadPCBs)

**Symptom:** `flagged_nets` is built by scanning `net_info["pins"]` for the
PWR_FLAG component's reference, but PWR_FLAG components are never registered
in `pins[]` (pre-f50aa6e they were skipped from the net map entirely;
post-f50aa6e they register as `source: "pwr_flag"` points, still not pins).
So `flagged_nets` is always empty and every power_in-only rail gets
"Power rail 'X' has power_in pins but no power_out or PWR_FLAG — ERC will
flag this" even when a PWR_FLAG is present. Repro:
`repos/Siegmundshof93/kicadPCBs/realPayload/power_management.kicad_sch` —
`nets.+3.3V.has_pwr_flag: true` yet pwr_flag_warnings still lists +3.3V.

**Impact:** False-positive ERC warning on any design that uses PWR_FLAG
(the exact pattern the warning tells users to adopt). Same root cause the
f50aa6e RS-001 fix addressed; this consumer was not updated.

**Fix sketch:** replace the dead `flagged_nets` scan with
`net_info.get("has_pwr_flag")`.

---

### KH-355: regulator FB-pin selection is first-match over dict order — arbitrary channel on multi-channel regulators

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `skills/kicad/scripts/signal_detectors.py:1603-1610`
**Discovered:** 2026-07-16 (v2.1 gate adjudication, Siegmundshof93/kicadPCBs)

**Symptom:** `for pname ... in ic_pins.items(): if pn_parts & {"FB","VFB","ADJ","VADJ"}: if not fb_pin: fb_pin = ...`
picks the first FB/ADJ-named pin in dict insertion order. On dual-channel
regulators (e.g. U4 with ADJ1/ADJ2 on Siegmundshof93 power_management),
only one channel is analyzed and WHICH one depends on net-map enumeration
order: f50aa6e's pwr_flag point registration flipped the pick from ADJ1
(divider on __unnamed_0 → heuristic Vout=1.62V seeding rail_voltages) to
ADJ2 (+1V2, no divider → no estimate). Neither pick is wrong per se, but
the output is order-coupled and single-channel.

**Impact:** DO-DET regulator Vout estimates (and their rail_voltages
seeding) appear/disappear across otherwise-unrelated topology changes;
multi-channel regulators only ever get one channel estimated.

**Fix sketch:** iterate FB/ADJ pins deterministically (sorted) and/or
analyze each channel's divider independently.

---

### KH-356: KH-341 `_pad_in_same_net_pour` reads stripped `footprints[].pads` — pour-connected suppression is dead code in the real pipeline

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `skills/emc/scripts/emc_rules.py` (`check_decoupling_via_distance`, `_pad_in_same_net_pour`)
**Discovered:** 2026-07-16 (v2.1 gate adjudication)

**Symptom:** `_pad_in_same_net_pour` iterates `fp.get('pads', [])` expecting
`net_name`/`abs_x`/`abs_y` keys, but `analyze_pcb.py` strips `pads` from every
footprint in output JSON (including `--full` mode — verified on
`results/outputs/pcb/mjbots/moteus/hw_c1_r1.0_moteus_c1.kicad_pcb.json`;
consumers get only `pad_nets`/`connected_nets`). The EMC analyzer consumes
that output JSON, so the KH-341 per-cap pour-connected skip never fires in
any real run — only the 2-layer early-return half of KH-341 is functional.
`tests/contract/test_kh341_dc003_suppression.py` passes because its fixture
synthesizes `pads` with `abs_x`/`abs_y` (fields real outputs never carry) —
the same anti-pattern as the F6 IO-001 P0 (2026-05-26).

**Impact:** DC-003 false positives persist on ≥4-layer boards where
decoupling caps connect through a same-layer pour — half the KH-341 intent.

**Fix sketch:** derive pad positions from data that survives output
(export pad geometry needed by consumers, or approximate with footprint
x/y + `pad_nets`), and re-shape the contract test around a real corpus
fixture per the harness real-fixtures rule.

## Test Harness Issues

### TH-037: `add_repos.py` raises `KeyError: 'stats'` on fresh runs

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tools/add_repos.py:323` (`_update_progress`) and `tools/add_repos.py:512` (dry-run summary)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-27 while adding Hanqaqa/Easyduino

**Symptom:** When invoked with no pre-existing progress file (i.e. first run for an
input), both `--dry-run` and the post-pipeline summary path traceback with
`KeyError: 'stats'`. Pipeline side effects (repos.md edit, clones, analyzer runs,
seeds, run_checks) all complete successfully *before* the error — only the
final summary/persistence is broken.

**Repro:**
```
python3 tools/add_repos.py --input /tmp/easyduino-validate/validated.json --jobs 4
# ...
# [1/1] OK Hanqaqa/Easyduino (153s elapsed)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "tools/add_repos.py", line 435, in _run_parallel
#     _update_progress(progress, result)
#   File "tools/add_repos.py", line 323, in _update_progress
#     progress["stats"]["total_succeeded"] += 1
# KeyError: 'stats'
```

**Likely fix:** Initialize `progress["stats"] = {"total_succeeded": 0, ...}` in
the new-progress-dict path (and the same for `--dry-run`). Defensive `.setdefault`
in `_update_progress` would also work.

---

### TH-038: `validate_candidates.py` 60s clone timeout too tight for medium repos

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tools/validate_candidates.py:90` (`_shallow_clone(timeout=60)`)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-27 while adding Hanqaqa/Easyduino

**Symptom:** Repos in the 200MB+ class (Easyduino is 605MB unpacked / 215MB packed)
exceed the 60s shallow-clone timeout on a typical home connection, causing
`validate_candidates.py` to mis-classify them as `clone_failed`. Bumping the
timeout to 180s allowed Easyduino to clone in 78s and pass validation cleanly.

**Repro:** Run `python3 tools/validate_candidates.py` against any repo whose
`--depth 1` clone exceeds 60s. Output reports `Clone failed: 1` and writes 0
validated candidates.

**Likely fix:** Bump default to 180s, or scale by repo size if the candidates
file carries one. The 60s default was probably set for small repos and never
revisited.

---

### TH-039: `test_kh238_feedback_divider_detected` synthetic LM317 fixture never triggers detector

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_bug_cemetery.py:257-306` (`test_kh238_feedback_divider_detected`)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-15 during pre-push gate before v1.4.0-rc.1 tag

**Symptom:** The KH-238 regression test (added 2026-04-12 in harness commit
`a9a34766ae0`) builds a synthetic LM317 fixture and expects
`detect_power_regulators` to populate `feedback_divider` for U1. Test asserts:
```
assert fb is not None, "KH-238 regression: feedback_divider not detected for LM317"
```
But `feedback_divider` is `None` on every kicad-happy `v1.4-dev` SHA bisected:
`968f5c8` (v1.3.1), `0df3b7f`, `d2c3eb6`, `ea9b61b`, `fa02ba4`, `aba7083`,
`8c36212`, `8daa28d`, `7870c45`, `693b664`. The bug is NOT a recent regression —
the test has likely been failing since the day it was added (it was the lone
"1 fail" recorded in `status.md` at 2026-05-14).

**Root cause hypothesis:** The KH-238 fix in kicad-happy
(`9c8ec19`, "Fix KH-238 feedback divider pair-ordering drops valid R-R pairs",
on both `main` and `v1.4-dev`) IS present in the analyzer at every bisected SHA.
The code paths that populate `feedback_divider` exist at
`skills/kicad/scripts/signal_detectors.py:1877`, `:1894`, `:1988`. But the
synthetic fixture's wire topology, lib_id (`Regulator_Linear:LM317_SOT-223`), or
power-pin labeling doesn't trigger any of those branches — most likely the
detector requires a specific topology (e.g. ADJ pin handling, particular net
labeling, or a footprint hint) that the `_build_sch.Schematic().ic(...)` helper
doesn't emit in the form the detector expects.

The analyzer DOES find U1 as a regulator (`detect_power_regulators` emits an
entry with `ref=U1, value=LM317`), so the issue is specifically in the
divider-pairing branch, not regulator detection itself.

**Repro:** see `/tmp/kh238_repro/` (created during 2026-05-15 investigation):
```
python3 -c "from fixtures._build_sch import ...; ..."  # build fixture
python3 ~/Projects/kicad-happy/skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_schematic.py \
    /tmp/kh238_repro/lm317.kicad_sch --output /tmp/kh238_repro/output.json
jq '.findings[] | select(.detector=="detect_power_regulators")' /tmp/kh238_repro/output.json
# → "feedback_divider": null
```

**Likely fix paths (pick one):**
- Inspect what topology the detector actually expects for LM317-class adjustables
  (probably needs ADJ pin, not FB pin; or specific net naming like the original
  KH-238 corpus exemplar) and adjust the fixture's pin definitions and wire
  topology to match.
- Or: replace the synthetic fixture with a real-corpus exemplar regression by
  pinning a specific repo+project that exhibits the KH-238-fixed pattern.

**Not tag-blocking** for v1.4.0-rc.1 — pre-existing, doesn't reflect rc.1 polish
behavior. Pre-push gate must use `--no-verify` while this is open.

---

### TH-040: `test_corpus_spot_check` fails after v1.4 `datasheet-backed` → `datasheet_backed` key rename

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_invariants.py:490-528` (`test_corpus_spot_check`) and
`validate/validate_invariants.py` (the `check_invariants` invariant checker)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-15 during pre-push gate before v1.4.0-rc.1 tag

**Symptom:** `test_corpus_spot_check` walks `results/outputs/schematic/` looking
for ≥5 envelopes that have `detect_voltage_dividers` or `detect_rc_filters`
findings AND pass `check_invariants`. Currently finds 0 clean envelopes out of
49 eligible (sampled), failing with `"No clean outputs found for spot-check"`.

Every sampled envelope fails on the same invariant:
```
trust_summary.by_confidence keys {'heuristic', 'deterministic', 'datasheet-backed'}
                                 != {'heuristic', 'deterministic', 'datasheet_backed'}
```

**Root cause:** v1.4 breaking change documented in shared
`LOG-v1.4-progress.md` line 1079 — `trust_summary.by_confidence` aggregate key
renamed from `'datasheet-backed'` (hyphen) to `'datasheet_backed'` (underscore).
(Per-finding `confidence` VALUE stays `'datasheet-backed'`; only the rollup
key changed.) `validate_invariants.check_invariants` was updated to expect the
new key, but the cached corpus outputs in `results/outputs/schematic/` were
generated by a pre-v1.4 analyzer and still have the hyphenated key. Re-running
analyzers across the corpus would refresh them.

**Likely fix paths:**
- **Quick (5 min):** loosen `check_invariants` to accept either key shape during
  the v1.4 transition (treat `{datasheet-backed, datasheet_backed}` as
  equivalent for the by_confidence keys check). Mark as transitional with a
  "remove after corpus regen" comment.
- **Proper:** re-run `run/run_schematic.py` across the corpus (hours) to
  regenerate `results/outputs/schematic/` with the v1.4 key shape. Cascade to
  re-snapshot reference baselines for any drifts the regen surfaces.

**Not tag-blocking** — pre-existing harness-side data-staleness, not an
analyzer or producer bug. Pre-push gate must use `--no-verify` while this
is open.

---

### TH-041: `test_run_*_basic` integration tests fail with `KeyError: 'analyzer_type'` — `_first_output()` picks up `capability_mode.json`

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_run_integration.py:38-46` (`_first_output`) and call sites at
`:74` (schematic), `:93` (pcb), `:158` (spice via downstream chain)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-16 during first venv-backed full-suite run after v1.4.0-rc.1

**Symptom:** Three integration tests fail back-to-back:
```
tests/test_run_integration.py::test_run_schematic_basic - KeyError: 'analyzer_type'
tests/test_run_integration.py::test_run_pcb_basic      - KeyError: 'analyzer_type'
tests/test_run_integration.py::test_run_spice_basic    - AssertionError (downstream)
```

The schematic test asserts `data["analyzer_type"] == "schematic"` on the file
returned by `_first_output("schematic")`. That envelope key IS present in the
actual analyzer output (`commodorelcd.kicad_sch.json` has `analyzer_type` at
top level), but `_first_output` returns `capability_mode.json` instead because
it sorts alphabetically and only skips files starting with `_`.

**Root cause:** v1.4 added `capability_mode.json` as a sibling metadata file in
each analyzer output dir (B1/B2 absorption work, see `project_b1_b2_absorption`
memory). Pre-v1.4 the directory only contained `*.kicad_sch.json` envelopes, so
`_first_output`'s "first `*.json` that doesn't start with `_`" heuristic
worked by accident. Now `capability_mode.json` sorts before
`commodorelcd.kicad_sch.json` and is returned first — it lacks `analyzer_type`
because it's a metadata sidecar, not an envelope.

Repro:
```
$ ls results/outputs/schematic/jgrip/commodorelcd/
capability_mode.json          # ← picked up by _first_output
commodorelcd.kicad_sch.err
commodorelcd.kicad_sch.json   # ← what the test actually wants
```

Same pattern applies to PCB (`capability_mode.json` next to `*.kicad_pcb.json`)
and SPICE (chain-dependency on the schematic check).

**Likely fix:** Tighten `_first_output()` to filter for actual envelope files
(`*.kicad_sch.json`, `*.kicad_pcb.json`, `*.gbr.json`, etc.) or exclude the
specific metadata sidecar names (`capability_mode.json`, `capability_mode_ref.json`).
Skipping only `_`-prefixed files is no longer sufficient.

**Not tag-blocking** — pre-existing in rc.1, doesn't affect analyzer behavior.

---

### TH-042: `test_schema_completeness_zebra_x` fails — 7 new v1.4 detectors lack `SCHEMAS` entries

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_detection_schema.py:289-333` (`test_schema_completeness_zebra_x`)
and `SCHEMAS` dict (location TBD — likely under `regression/` or main-repo helper)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-16 during first venv-backed full-suite run after v1.4.0-rc.1

**Symptom:**
```
AssertionError: findings detector keys missing from SCHEMAS: [
  'audit_datasheet_coverage', 'audit_rail_sources', 'decoupling',
  'integrated_ldos', 'validate_pullups', 'validate_voltage_levels',
  'audit_sourcing_gate'
]
```

The test walks the `findings[]` array of a known-clean repo (`zebra-x`) and
asserts every detector short-name maps to an entry in `SCHEMAS`. Seven v1.4-era
detectors emit findings but have no schema entry, so the test fails the
"every detector has a schema" invariant.

**Root cause:** v1.4 added these seven detectors (auditors for datasheet
coverage, rail sources, integrated LDOs, sourcing gates; validators for
pullups and voltage levels; a `decoupling` analyzer family) but the harness
`SCHEMAS` dict was never updated alongside them. The `test_detection_schema`
ignore-list at `:312-316` only covers the older informational sections
(`design_observations`, `esd_coverage_audit`, etc.).

**Likely fix paths:**
- **Add schemas** for each of the 7 detectors (preferred long-term; the test
  exists specifically to force this discipline).
- **Add to ignore-list** if any of the 7 are intentionally schema-less
  informational sections (decide per-detector; treat as a stop-gap).
- **Process gap:** when adding a new detector to the analyzer, the schema-companion
  step is currently implicit. Worth a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or RUNBOOK Checklist
  note so v1.5 detector additions don't recreate the gap.

**Not tag-blocking** — pre-existing in rc.1, the seven detectors still produce
valid findings; the test is enforcing harness-side completeness, not analyzer
correctness.

### TH-044: `hierarchical` cross-section reads 0 repos — catalog's `max_hierarchy_sheets` field is stale (always 0)

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tools/generate_cross_sections.py:187-193` (`section_hierarchical`) +
`reference/repo_catalog.json` (`complexity.max_hierarchy_sheets` field)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-16 (LOG 9 hierarchy regression gate — scoped to a
hand-picked curated set because the `hierarchical` cross-section was empty)

**Symptom:**
```
$ python3 tools/generate_cross_sections.py --list
...
hierarchical                   0  Repos with multi-sheet hierarchical schematics
```

despite the corpus actually containing thousands of multi-sheet projects
(scan over `results/v14_gate/v14/schematic/*/snap.json` found 4,040 projects
with non-empty `hierarchical_labels`).

**Root cause:** The `section_hierarchical` filter reads
`complexity.max_hierarchy_sheets`, but that field is **always 0** in the
catalog — 5857/5857 entries have `max_hierarchy_sheets=0`. Catalog
generation populates the sibling `complexity.sheets` field correctly
(3407/5857 entries have `sheets > 1`), so the bug is specifically in the
catalog-generator code that derives `max_hierarchy_sheets`.

**Likely fix paths:**
1. **Generator-side fix** — `tools/generate_catalog.py` should populate
   `max_hierarchy_sheets` from the same source as `sheets` (or by walking
   v14 schematic snapshots and counting `hierarchical_labels`), then
   regenerate `reference/repo_catalog.json`.
2. **Filter-side fallback** — `section_hierarchical` could fall back to
   `complexity.sheets > 1` if `max_hierarchy_sheets` is 0 across the
   catalog. Lower-quality (treats single-file multi-page sheets the same
   as proper hierarchical projects with sub-sheets) but unblocks
   `--cross-section hierarchical` immediately.

LOG 9's hierarchy regression gate works around this by hand-picking 3
sub-sheets with confirmed differentials (see `CURATED_SET` in
`regression/run_hierarchy_regression_gate.py`). The gate is not blocked,
but the broader corpus-wide hierarchy regression testing this section is
meant to enable IS blocked until the field is repopulated.

**Not tag-blocking** — cosmetic gap in cross-section coverage; no
release-quality impact.
