# Issue Tracker

Single source of truth for kicad-happy analyzer bugs (KH-*) and test harness
issues (TH-*). Contains enough detail to resume work with zero conversation
history. Enhancements and features are tracked in `TODO-v1.3-roadmap.md`
in each repo, not here.

> **Protocol**: When fixing issues, remove them from this file and add to FIXED.md in the
> same session. See README.md "Issue tracking protocol" for full details. Closed issues
> with root cause and verification details are in [FIXED.md](FIXED.md).

> **Reporting guidelines for Level 3 subagents**: Root cause descriptions must cite
> specific function names and line numbers, not just file names. When claiming code
> "doesn't check X", trace the actual code path for the repro input and show which line
> returns the wrong result — don't infer from the symptom what the code must be doing.
> Common pitfalls:
> - Code checks the right field but matches the wrong strings (KH-213: checked keywords
>   for `p-channel` but actual keywords contain `PMOS`)
> - Code has the right pattern but wrong format (KH-209: matched `Vnn` but not `nnVn`)
> - Fix exists but callers bypass it (KH-212: KH-153 fix requires `component_type` param
>   that callers don't pass)
> - Transforms are applied but decomposed wrong (KH-207: `compute_pin_positions` runs but
>   matrix→angle extraction is mathematically incorrect)
>
> Include in every report: (1) the function name and line number that produces the wrong
> result, (2) the actual input values from the repro file, (3) what the code returns vs
> what it should return.

## Test Harness Issues

### TH-037: `add_repos.py` raises `KeyError: 'stats'` on fresh runs

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tools/add_repos.py:323` (`_update_progress`) and `tools/add_repos.py:512` (dry-run summary)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-27 while adding Hanqaqa/Easyduino

**Symptom:** When invoked with no pre-existing progress file (i.e. first run for an
input), both `--dry-run` and the post-pipeline summary path traceback with
`KeyError: 'stats'`. Pipeline side effects (repos.md edit, clones, analyzer runs,
seeds, run_checks) all complete successfully *before* the error — only the
final summary/persistence is broken.

**Repro:**
```
python3 tools/add_repos.py --input /tmp/easyduino-validate/validated.json --jobs 4
# ...
# [1/1] OK Hanqaqa/Easyduino (153s elapsed)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "tools/add_repos.py", line 435, in _run_parallel
#     _update_progress(progress, result)
#   File "tools/add_repos.py", line 323, in _update_progress
#     progress["stats"]["total_succeeded"] += 1
# KeyError: 'stats'
```

**Likely fix:** Initialize `progress["stats"] = {"total_succeeded": 0, ...}` in
the new-progress-dict path (and the same for `--dry-run`). Defensive `.setdefault`
in `_update_progress` would also work.

---

### TH-038: `validate_candidates.py` 60s clone timeout too tight for medium repos

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tools/validate_candidates.py:90` (`_shallow_clone(timeout=60)`)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-27 while adding Hanqaqa/Easyduino

**Symptom:** Repos in the 200MB+ class (Easyduino is 605MB unpacked / 215MB packed)
exceed the 60s shallow-clone timeout on a typical home connection, causing
`validate_candidates.py` to mis-classify them as `clone_failed`. Bumping the
timeout to 180s allowed Easyduino to clone in 78s and pass validation cleanly.

**Repro:** Run `python3 tools/validate_candidates.py` against any repo whose
`--depth 1` clone exceeds 60s. Output reports `Clone failed: 1` and writes 0
validated candidates.

**Likely fix:** Bump default to 180s, or scale by repo size if the candidates
file carries one. The 60s default was probably set for small repos and never
revisited.

### TH-039: `test_kh238_feedback_divider_detected` synthetic LM317 fixture never triggers detector

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_bug_cemetery.py:257-306` (`test_kh238_feedback_divider_detected`)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-15 during pre-push gate before v1.4.0-rc.1 tag

**Symptom:** The KH-238 regression test (added 2026-04-12 in harness commit
`a9a34766ae0`) builds a synthetic LM317 fixture and expects
`detect_power_regulators` to populate `feedback_divider` for U1. Test asserts:
```
assert fb is not None, "KH-238 regression: feedback_divider not detected for LM317"
```
But `feedback_divider` is `None` on every kicad-happy `v1.4-dev` SHA bisected:
`968f5c8` (v1.3.1), `0df3b7f`, `d2c3eb6`, `ea9b61b`, `fa02ba4`, `aba7083`,
`8c36212`, `8daa28d`, `7870c45`, `693b664`. The bug is NOT a recent regression —
the test has likely been failing since the day it was added (it was the lone
"1 fail" recorded in `status.md` at 2026-05-14).

**Root cause hypothesis:** The KH-238 fix in kicad-happy
(`9c8ec19`, "Fix KH-238 feedback divider pair-ordering drops valid R-R pairs",
on both `main` and `v1.4-dev`) IS present in the analyzer at every bisected SHA.
The code paths that populate `feedback_divider` exist at
`skills/kicad/scripts/signal_detectors.py:1877`, `:1894`, `:1988`. But the
synthetic fixture's wire topology, lib_id (`Regulator_Linear:LM317_SOT-223`), or
power-pin labeling doesn't trigger any of those branches — most likely the
detector requires a specific topology (e.g. ADJ pin handling, particular net
labeling, or a footprint hint) that the `_build_sch.Schematic().ic(...)` helper
doesn't emit in the form the detector expects.

The analyzer DOES find U1 as a regulator (`detect_power_regulators` emits an
entry with `ref=U1, value=LM317`), so the issue is specifically in the
divider-pairing branch, not regulator detection itself.

**Repro:** see `/tmp/kh238_repro/` (created during 2026-05-15 investigation):
```
python3 -c "from fixtures._build_sch import ...; ..."  # build fixture
python3 ~/Projects/kicad-happy/skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_schematic.py \
    /tmp/kh238_repro/lm317.kicad_sch --output /tmp/kh238_repro/output.json
jq '.findings[] | select(.detector=="detect_power_regulators")' /tmp/kh238_repro/output.json
# → "feedback_divider": null
```

**Likely fix paths (pick one):**
- Inspect what topology the detector actually expects for LM317-class adjustables
  (probably needs ADJ pin, not FB pin; or specific net naming like the original
  KH-238 corpus exemplar) and adjust the fixture's pin definitions and wire
  topology to match.
- Or: replace the synthetic fixture with a real-corpus exemplar regression by
  pinning a specific repo+project that exhibits the KH-238-fixed pattern.

**Not tag-blocking** for v1.4.0-rc.1 — pre-existing, doesn't reflect rc.1 polish
behavior. Pre-push gate must use `--no-verify` while this is open.

### TH-040: `test_corpus_spot_check` fails after v1.4 `datasheet-backed` → `datasheet_backed` key rename

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_invariants.py:490-528` (`test_corpus_spot_check`) and
`validate/validate_invariants.py` (the `check_invariants` invariant checker)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-15 during pre-push gate before v1.4.0-rc.1 tag

**Symptom:** `test_corpus_spot_check` walks `results/outputs/schematic/` looking
for ≥5 envelopes that have `detect_voltage_dividers` or `detect_rc_filters`
findings AND pass `check_invariants`. Currently finds 0 clean envelopes out of
49 eligible (sampled), failing with `"No clean outputs found for spot-check"`.

Every sampled envelope fails on the same invariant:
```
trust_summary.by_confidence keys {'heuristic', 'deterministic', 'datasheet-backed'}
                                 != {'heuristic', 'deterministic', 'datasheet_backed'}
```

**Root cause:** v1.4 breaking change documented in shared
`LOG-v1.4-progress.md` line 1079 — `trust_summary.by_confidence` aggregate key
renamed from `'datasheet-backed'` (hyphen) to `'datasheet_backed'` (underscore).
(Per-finding `confidence` VALUE stays `'datasheet-backed'`; only the rollup
key changed.) `validate_invariants.check_invariants` was updated to expect the
new key, but the cached corpus outputs in `results/outputs/schematic/` were
generated by a pre-v1.4 analyzer and still have the hyphenated key. Re-running
analyzers across the corpus would refresh them.

**Likely fix paths:**
- **Quick (5 min):** loosen `check_invariants` to accept either key shape during
  the v1.4 transition (treat `{datasheet-backed, datasheet_backed}` as
  equivalent for the by_confidence keys check). Mark as transitional with a
  "remove after corpus regen" comment.
- **Proper:** re-run `run/run_schematic.py` across the corpus (hours) to
  regenerate `results/outputs/schematic/` with the v1.4 key shape. Cascade to
  re-snapshot reference baselines for any drifts the regen surfaces.

**Not tag-blocking** — pre-existing harness-side data-staleness, not an
analyzer or producer bug. Pre-push gate must use `--no-verify` while this
is open.

### TH-041: `test_run_*_basic` integration tests fail with `KeyError: 'analyzer_type'` — `_first_output()` picks up `capability_mode.json`

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_run_integration.py:38-46` (`_first_output`) and call sites at
`:74` (schematic), `:93` (pcb), `:158` (spice via downstream chain)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-16 during first venv-backed full-suite run after v1.4.0-rc.1

**Symptom:** Three integration tests fail back-to-back:
```
tests/test_run_integration.py::test_run_schematic_basic - KeyError: 'analyzer_type'
tests/test_run_integration.py::test_run_pcb_basic      - KeyError: 'analyzer_type'
tests/test_run_integration.py::test_run_spice_basic    - AssertionError (downstream)
```

The schematic test asserts `data["analyzer_type"] == "schematic"` on the file
returned by `_first_output("schematic")`. That envelope key IS present in the
actual analyzer output (`commodorelcd.kicad_sch.json` has `analyzer_type` at
top level), but `_first_output` returns `capability_mode.json` instead because
it sorts alphabetically and only skips files starting with `_`.

**Root cause:** v1.4 added `capability_mode.json` as a sibling metadata file in
each analyzer output dir (B1/B2 absorption work, see `project_b1_b2_absorption`
memory). Pre-v1.4 the directory only contained `*.kicad_sch.json` envelopes, so
`_first_output`'s "first `*.json` that doesn't start with `_`" heuristic
worked by accident. Now `capability_mode.json` sorts before
`commodorelcd.kicad_sch.json` and is returned first — it lacks `analyzer_type`
because it's a metadata sidecar, not an envelope.

Repro:
```
$ ls results/outputs/schematic/jgrip/commodorelcd/
capability_mode.json          # ← picked up by _first_output
commodorelcd.kicad_sch.err
commodorelcd.kicad_sch.json   # ← what the test actually wants
```

Same pattern applies to PCB (`capability_mode.json` next to `*.kicad_pcb.json`)
and SPICE (chain-dependency on the schematic check).

**Likely fix:** Tighten `_first_output()` to filter for actual envelope files
(`*.kicad_sch.json`, `*.kicad_pcb.json`, `*.gbr.json`, etc.) or exclude the
specific metadata sidecar names (`capability_mode.json`, `capability_mode_ref.json`).
Skipping only `_`-prefixed files is no longer sufficient.

**Not tag-blocking** — pre-existing in rc.1, doesn't affect analyzer behavior.

### TH-042: `test_schema_completeness_zebra_x` fails — 7 new v1.4 detectors lack `SCHEMAS` entries

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_detection_schema.py:289-333` (`test_schema_completeness_zebra_x`)
and `SCHEMAS` dict (location TBD — likely under `regression/` or main-repo helper)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-16 during first venv-backed full-suite run after v1.4.0-rc.1

**Symptom:**
```
AssertionError: findings detector keys missing from SCHEMAS: [
  'audit_datasheet_coverage', 'audit_rail_sources', 'decoupling',
  'integrated_ldos', 'validate_pullups', 'validate_voltage_levels',
  'audit_sourcing_gate'
]
```

The test walks the `findings[]` array of a known-clean repo (`zebra-x`) and
asserts every detector short-name maps to an entry in `SCHEMAS`. Seven v1.4-era
detectors emit findings but have no schema entry, so the test fails the
"every detector has a schema" invariant.

**Root cause:** v1.4 added these seven detectors (auditors for datasheet
coverage, rail sources, integrated LDOs, sourcing gates; validators for
pullups and voltage levels; a `decoupling` analyzer family) but the harness
`SCHEMAS` dict was never updated alongside them. The `test_detection_schema`
ignore-list at `:312-316` only covers the older informational sections
(`design_observations`, `esd_coverage_audit`, etc.).

**Likely fix paths:**
- **Add schemas** for each of the 7 detectors (preferred long-term; the test
  exists specifically to force this discipline).
- **Add to ignore-list** if any of the 7 are intentionally schema-less
  informational sections (decide per-detector; treat as a stop-gap).
- **Process gap:** when adding a new detector to the analyzer, the schema-companion
  step is currently implicit. Worth a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or RUNBOOK Checklist
  note so v1.5 detector additions don't recreate the gap.

**Not tag-blocking** — pre-existing in rc.1, the seven detectors still produce
valid findings; the test is enforcing harness-side completeness, not analyzer
correctness.

### TH-043: `--schema` lists required keys not always emitted — schema-vs-emitter drift across schematic / pcb / gerber / thermal

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tests/test_schema_drift.py:239` (`test_pcb_schema_drift`) +
`regression/run_v14_default_contract_gate.py` (corpus-wide gate) +
`<kicad-happy>/skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_{schematic,pcb,gerbers,thermal}.py`
`--schema` output
**Discovered:** 2026-05-16 (PCB during first venv-backed full-suite run;
schematic/gerber/thermal scope widened from LOG 8 default-contract gate run
@ 87274cb701d over 149,566 v14 snapshots)

**Symptom (pcb, originally filed):**
```
AssertionError: pcb: --schema documents required keys not in emitted output:
  ['board_metadata', 'board_thickness_mm', 'ground_domains',
   'placement_density', 'power_net_routing'].
Either remove from --schema `required`, or emit them unconditionally.
```

**Corpus-wide scope (LOG 8 gate evidence, 2026-05-16):**

| Analyzer | FAIL / total | Rate | Example drift |
|----------|--------------|------|---------------|
| pcb | 18004 / 18658 | 96.5% | `board_metadata`, `board_thickness_mm`, `design_rule_compliance` required but absent |
| schematic | 32030 / 36462 | 87.8% | `title_block` required but absent (empty dict elsewhere; absent here) |
| gerber | 3621 / 5439 | 66.6% | `pad_summary.smd_ratio`, `completeness.expected_layers` required but absent |
| thermal | 1364 / 16083 | 8.5% | `missing_info.default_rtheta_ja` required but absent |
| emc | 0 / 36462 | 0% | clean — schema in sync |
| cross_analysis | 0 / 36462 | 0% | clean — schema in sync |

Same bug class corpus-wide: `--schema` declares fields as `required` that
analyzers emit conditionally (or not at all). All 4 affected analyzers share
the same fix-path categorization — drop from `required` (genuinely
conditional) or emit unconditionally (real regression). EMC + cross_analysis
are the existence proof that the bug class is fixable.

**Root cause hypothesis:** Some keys are conditionally emitted depending on
board content (e.g. `ground_domains` only if a ground net exists,
`power_net_routing` only if power nets are routed, `title_block` only when
the source has one), but the `--schema` `required` list doesn't reflect that
conditionality. Other keys (`board_metadata`, `board_thickness_mm`,
`placement_density`, thermal's `default_rtheta_ja`) sound unconditional and
should always be emitted — those may be regression-bugs in the analyzers.

**Likely fix paths (decide per key per analyzer):**
- **Drop from `required`:** for genuinely-conditional keys.
- **Emit unconditionally:** for keys that should always appear — file as KH-*
  in the main-repo per analyzer if confirmed.

This is a **kicad-happy main-repo concern** across 4 analyzers, not a harness
bug. The harness gate (`run_v14_default_contract_gate.py`) is the
symptom-surfacing layer; the actual fix lands in main-repo per-analyzer
`--schema` definitions and/or unconditional-emit code paths.

**Not tag-blocking** — pre-existing in rc.1, schema-vs-output mismatch only
affects strict consumers, not the default-mode report. Re-run the gate after
each per-analyzer fix to confirm the failure rate drops.

### TH-044: `hierarchical` cross-section reads 0 repos — catalog's `max_hierarchy_sheets` field is stale (always 0)

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tools/generate_cross_sections.py:187-193` (`section_hierarchical`) +
`reference/repo_catalog.json` (`complexity.max_hierarchy_sheets` field)
**Discovered:** 2026-05-16 (LOG 9 hierarchy regression gate — scoped to a
hand-picked curated set because the `hierarchical` cross-section was empty)

**Symptom:**
```
$ python3 tools/generate_cross_sections.py --list
...
hierarchical                   0  Repos with multi-sheet hierarchical schematics
```

despite the corpus actually containing thousands of multi-sheet projects
(scan over `results/v14_gate/v14/schematic/*/snap.json` found 4,040 projects
with non-empty `hierarchical_labels`).

**Root cause:** The `section_hierarchical` filter reads
`complexity.max_hierarchy_sheets`, but that field is **always 0** in the
catalog — 5857/5857 entries have `max_hierarchy_sheets=0`. Catalog
generation populates the sibling `complexity.sheets` field correctly
(3407/5857 entries have `sheets > 1`), so the bug is specifically in the
catalog-generator code that derives `max_hierarchy_sheets`.

**Likely fix paths:**
1. **Generator-side fix** — `tools/generate_catalog.py` should populate
   `max_hierarchy_sheets` from the same source as `sheets` (or by walking
   v14 schematic snapshots and counting `hierarchical_labels`), then
   regenerate `reference/repo_catalog.json`.
2. **Filter-side fallback** — `section_hierarchical` could fall back to
   `complexity.sheets > 1` if `max_hierarchy_sheets` is 0 across the
   catalog. Lower-quality (treats single-file multi-page sheets the same
   as proper hierarchical projects with sub-sheets) but unblocks
   `--cross-section hierarchical` immediately.

LOG 9's hierarchy regression gate works around this by hand-picking 3
sub-sheets with confirmed differentials (see `CURATED_SET` in
`regression/run_hierarchy_regression_gate.py`). The gate is not blocked,
but the broader corpus-wide hierarchy regression testing this section is
meant to enable IS blocked until the field is repopulated.

**Not tag-blocking** — cosmetic gap in cross-section coverage; no
release-quality impact.
