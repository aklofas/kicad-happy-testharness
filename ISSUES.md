# Issue Tracker

Single source of truth for kicad-happy analyzer bugs (KH-*) and test harness
issues (TH-*). Contains enough detail to resume work with zero conversation
history. Enhancements and features are tracked in `TODO-v1.3-roadmap.md`
in each repo, not here.

> **Protocol**: When fixing issues, remove them from this file and add to FIXED.md in the
> same session. See README.md "Issue tracking protocol" for full details. Closed issues
> with root cause and verification details are in [FIXED.md](FIXED.md).

> **Reporting guidelines for Level 3 subagents**: Root cause descriptions must cite
> specific function names and line numbers, not just file names. When claiming code
> "doesn't check X", trace the actual code path for the repro input and show which line
> returns the wrong result — don't infer from the symptom what the code must be doing.
> Common pitfalls:
> - Code checks the right field but matches the wrong strings (KH-213: checked keywords
>   for `p-channel` but actual keywords contain `PMOS`)
> - Code has the right pattern but wrong format (KH-209: matched `Vnn` but not `nnVn`)
> - Fix exists but callers bypass it (KH-212: KH-153 fix requires `component_type` param
>   that callers don't pass)
> - Transforms are applied but decomposed wrong (KH-207: `compute_pin_positions` runs but
>   matrix→angle extraction is mathematically incorrect)
>
> Include in every report: (1) the function name and line number that produces the wrong
> result, (2) the actual input values from the repro file, (3) what the code returns vs
> what it should return.

## Numbering convention

Issue numbers are **globally unique and never reused**. Before assigning a new
number, check both ISSUES.md (open) and FIXED.md (closed) for the current
maximum. Next KH number: **KH-327**. Next TH number: **TH-039**.

> 2 open issues.

---

## Severity levels

- **CRITICAL** -- Causes cascading failures, major data loss, or makes large portions of output unusable
- **HIGH** -- Significant accuracy impact, many false positives/negatives, or missing important data
- **MEDIUM** -- Localized false positives or misclassifications; workarounds exist
- **LOW** -- Cosmetic, minor noise, or edge cases affecting few files

## Test Harness Issues

### TH-037: `add_repos.py` raises `KeyError: 'stats'` on fresh runs

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tools/add_repos.py:323` (`_update_progress`) and `tools/add_repos.py:512` (dry-run summary)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-27 while adding Hanqaqa/Easyduino

**Symptom:** When invoked with no pre-existing progress file (i.e. first run for an
input), both `--dry-run` and the post-pipeline summary path traceback with
`KeyError: 'stats'`. Pipeline side effects (repos.md edit, clones, analyzer runs,
seeds, run_checks) all complete successfully *before* the error — only the
final summary/persistence is broken.

**Repro:**
```
python3 tools/add_repos.py --input /tmp/easyduino-validate/validated.json --jobs 4
# ...
# [1/1] OK Hanqaqa/Easyduino (153s elapsed)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "tools/add_repos.py", line 435, in _run_parallel
#     _update_progress(progress, result)
#   File "tools/add_repos.py", line 323, in _update_progress
#     progress["stats"]["total_succeeded"] += 1
# KeyError: 'stats'
```

**Likely fix:** Initialize `progress["stats"] = {"total_succeeded": 0, ...}` in
the new-progress-dict path (and the same for `--dry-run`). Defensive `.setdefault`
in `_update_progress` would also work.

### TH-038: `validate_candidates.py` 60s clone timeout too tight for medium repos

**Severity:** LOW
**File:** `tools/validate_candidates.py:90` (`_shallow_clone(timeout=60)`)
**Discovered:** 2026-04-27 while adding Hanqaqa/Easyduino

**Symptom:** Repos in the 200MB+ class (Easyduino is 605MB unpacked / 215MB packed)
exceed the 60s shallow-clone timeout on a typical home connection, causing
`validate_candidates.py` to mis-classify them as `clone_failed`. Bumping the
timeout to 180s allowed Easyduino to clone in 78s and pass validation cleanly.

**Repro:** Run `python3 tools/validate_candidates.py` against any repo whose
`--depth 1` clone exceeds 60s. Output reports `Clone failed: 1` and writes 0
validated candidates.

**Likely fix:** Bump default to 180s, or scale by repo size if the candidates
file carries one. The 60s default was probably set for small repos and never
revisited.
