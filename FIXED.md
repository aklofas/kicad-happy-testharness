## 2026-03-13 — KH-027 through KH-040 (batch fix, 14 issues)

Source repos reviewed: hackrf, bitaxe, icebreaker, moteus, OtterCastAudioV2

### KH-027 (CRITICAL): Symbol name filter skips valid custom symbols

- **File**: `analyze_schematic.py` — `extract_lib_symbols()`
- **Root cause**: Sub-unit filter `name.split("_")[-1].isdigit()` matched any symbol
  ending in `_<digit>`, not just sub-unit patterns like `Device:C_0_1`.
- **Fix**: Changed to `rsplit("_", 2)` and require both last two segments are digits.
  `Q_NMOS_CSD17311Q5_1` → parts `["Q_NMOS", "CSD17311Q5", "1"]` → not filtered.
  `Device:C_0_1` → parts `["C", "0", "1"]` → correctly filtered.
- **Verified**: bitaxe Q1/Q2 now `type=transistor` (were missing from lib_symbols entirely).

### KH-028 (HIGH): Ferrite bead values parsed as henries

- **Files**: `kicad_utils.py` — `classify_component()`, `signal_detectors.py` — `detect_lc_filters()`
- **Root cause**: L-prefix components with "ferrite"/"bead" in lib_id/value were classified
  as `inductor`. Their impedance values (e.g., "600" = 600Ω @ 100MHz) were treated as
  henries, producing nonsensical LC filter results.
- **Fix**: (1) `classify_component()` now returns `ferrite_bead` when lib_id or value
  contains "ferrite" or "bead". (2) `detect_lc_filters()` skips components with
  `type == "ferrite_bead"` or ferrite/bead keywords.
- **Limitation**: Doesn't catch rescue-library ferrite beads with generic symbol names
  and bare numeric values (e.g., icebreaker L1/L2 = `pkl_L_Small` value `600`). Would
  need heuristic value-range detection for those.
- **Verified**: Components with ferrite metadata correctly reclassified and excluded from LC filters.

### KH-029 (HIGH): MPN field aliases (PARTNO, Part Number)

- **File**: `analyze_schematic.py` — KiCad 6+ property chain and legacy field handler
- **Root cause**: MPN extraction only recognized a narrow set of field names. Common
  alternatives `PARTNO`, `Part Number`, `PART_NUMBER` were not mapped.
- **Fix**: Added `PARTNO`, `PartNo`, `Partno` to KiCad 6+ `get_property()` chain.
  Added `PARTNO`, `PART NUMBER`, `PART_NUMBER`, `PART NO` to legacy field name tuple.
- **Verified**: bitaxe 86/136 components now have MPNs populated (was 0).

### KH-030 (HIGH): Current sense with IC-integrated amplifier

- **File**: `signal_detectors.py` — `detect_current_sense()`
- **Root cause**: Detector only matched shunt + discrete sense IC topology. Gate drivers
  and power ICs with integrated CSA inputs (CSP/CSN/SEN/ISENSE pins) were not detected.
- **Fix**: Added second-pass loop over unmatched shunt candidates. Checks if either shunt
  net connects to an IC pin with a CSA-related name from `_integrated_csa_pins` frozenset.
  Creates entry with `type: "integrated_csa"`.
- **Limitation**: moteus DRV8323 not matched because shunt→CSA path goes through net ties
  and RC filters, and KH-026 (multi-instance net merging) prevents correct net resolution.
- **Verified**: Detection works for direct shunt-to-IC-pin topologies.

### KH-031 (HIGH): RF antenna matching networks

- **File**: `signal_detectors.py` — new `detect_rf_matching()`
- **Root cause**: No detector existed for antenna matching networks.
- **Fix**: New function finds antenna connectors (AE*/ANT* prefix or antenna/u.fl/sma
  keywords), BFS through L/C components (max 6 hops), classifies topology:
  - `pi_match`: ≥1 series L + ≥2 shunt C
  - `T_match`: ≥2 series L + ≥1 shunt C
  - `L_match`: 2 components, 1 series + 1 shunt
  - `matching_network`: other arrangements
  Reports target IC if BFS reaches one.
- **Wiring**: Added to `analyze_signal_paths()` imports, call, and results dict as `rf_matching`.
- **Verified**: Compiles and runs on all 9 test repos.

### KH-032 (HIGH): SDIO bus protocol detection

- **File**: `analyze_schematic.py` — `analyze_design_rules()` bus detection section
- **Root cause**: No SDIO/SD/eMMC bus category existed in the bus protocol detector.
- **Fix**: Added SDIO detection after UART, before CAN. Matches net names with prefixes
  `SDIO`, `SD_`, `SD1_`, `SD2_`, `EMMC`, `MMC`, `WL_SDIO` combined with CLK/CMD/D0-D7
  signals. Requires CLK + CMD + D0 minimum. Reports bus width, pull-up presence on CMD
  and data lines, and connected IC devices.
- **Verified**: OtterCastAudioV2 detects both `SD` (SDC0_*) and `SDIO` (WL_SDIO_*) buses,
  4-bit width, pull-ups on CMD+D0-D3.

### KH-033 (MEDIUM): DNP from value/Note field

- **File**: `analyze_schematic.py` — KiCad 6+ and legacy paths
- **Root cause**: Only checked explicit KiCad 7+ `dnp` attribute or field named "DNP".
  Designs using `value="DNP"` or `Note="DNP"` convention were not recognized.
- **Fix**: KiCad 6+ path: after `dnp = get_value(sym, "dnp") == "yes"`, check if value
  is in `("DNP", "DO NOT POPULATE", "DO NOT PLACE", "NP")`. Legacy path: same value
  check after field processing, plus `NOTE`/`NOTES`/`COMMENT` field value check.
- **Verified**: OtterCastAudioV2 C49 now `dnp=True` (value="DNP").

### KH-034 (MEDIUM): Active oscillator detection

- **File**: `signal_detectors.py` — `detect_crystal_circuits()`
- **Root cause**: Only passive crystals with load caps were detected. Active oscillators
  (TCXO, VCXO, MEMS) with VDD/GND/OUT pins were ignored.
- **Fix**: Added loop after passive crystal detection, before return. Matches components
  with `type == "oscillator"` or oscillator keywords in value/lib_id. Identifies output
  pin by name (OUT/CLK/CLKOUT) or falls back to first non-power/non-ground pin. Emits
  entries with `type: "active_oscillator"` and empty `load_caps`.
- **Verified**: Compiles and runs on all test repos.

### KH-035 (MEDIUM): Integrated LDO on IC pins

- **File**: `signal_detectors.py` — new `detect_integrated_ldos()`
- **Root cause**: ICs with internal LDOs (e.g., FT2232H VREGOUT pin) were not detected
  as power sources.
- **Fix**: New function scans ICs not already in `power_regulators` for pins named
  `VREGOUT`, `VREG`, `LDO_OUT`, `REGOUT`, etc. If pin drives a power net (not ground),
  adds entry with `topology: "integrated_ldo"`. Results appended to `power_regulators`.
- **Verified**: Compiles and runs on all test repos.

### KH-036 (MEDIUM): LC filter parallel cap merging

- **File**: `signal_detectors.py` — `detect_lc_filters()`
- **Root cause**: Caps were grouped for parallel merging by `(inductor_ref, shared_net)`
  only. Caps with different "other" nets (series vs shunt topology) were falsely merged.
- **Fix**: Changed grouping key to include the cap's other net:
  `(ind_ref, shared_net, cap_other_net)`. Only caps sharing both terminals get merged.
- **Verified**: Compiles and runs on all test repos.

### KH-037 (MEDIUM): IC with internal regulator

- **File**: `signal_detectors.py` — `detect_power_regulators()`
- **Root cause**: Complex ICs with internal switching regulators (e.g., AP6236 WiFi module
  with SW pin + inductor) classified as dedicated power regulators.
- **Fix**: After topology classification, check pin ratio. If IC has >10 total pins and
  <20% are regulator-related names (VIN/VOUT/FB/SW/EN/BST/etc.), set topology to
  `"ic_with_internal_regulator"`.
- **Verified**: Compiles and runs on all test repos.

### KH-038 (MEDIUM): Sense inputs vs power domain

- **File**: `analyze_schematic.py` — power domain mapping in `analyze_design_rules()`
- **Root cause**: IC sense/measurement pins (IN+, IN-, SENSE, CSP, CSN) connected to
  power rails being monitored were included in the IC's power domain, causing false
  cross-domain warnings.
- **Fix**: Added `_sense_pin_names` exclusion set. Pins with these names are skipped
  before power domain classification.
- **Verified**: Compiles and runs on all test repos.

### KH-039 (MEDIUM): Power rail detection beyond power symbols

- **File**: `analyze_schematic.py` — `build_statistics()`
- **Root cause**: `power_rails` only included nets from `power_symbol` components.
  Nets defined by local/hierarchical labels matching voltage patterns (e.g., "3V3",
  "VIN_M") were missed.
- **Fix**: After collecting power symbol rails, also scan all net names through
  `is_power_net_name()` and add matches.
- **Verified**: Compiles and runs on all test repos.

### KH-040 (MEDIUM): Legacy Description field

- **File**: `analyze_schematic.py` — legacy custom field handler
- **Root cause**: No case for `DESCRIPTION` or `DESC` field names in the legacy parser's
  custom field handler.
- **Fix**: Added `elif fu in ("DESCRIPTION", "DESC"): comp["description"] = field_val`.
- **Verified**: Compiles and runs on all test repos.
